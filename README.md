# 👚 Saleling: Sales & Inventory Management System

**Saleling** is a comprehensive **Point-of-Sale (POS) and Inventory Management System** specifically designed for a **clothing apparel business**. Developed as a **Windows Forms application**, it utilizes an **event-driven** approach and strictly adheres to the **UI-Model-Controller-Repository (UMCR)** architectural pattern to ensure scalability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture: UI-Model-Controller-Repository (UMCR)

The project separates concerns across four distinct layers:

* **UI (User Interface):** Built with **Windows Forms** to display data and handle all **event-driven programming** interactions.
* **Model:** Simple C\# objects that define the data structure (e.g., `Apparel`, `User`, `Transaction`).
* **Controller:** Contains the application's **business logic**. It receives input from the UI and coordinates data flow with the Repository.
* **Repository:** Manages all **data access** operations (CRUD) against the database, abstracting the data source from the Controller.

### Code & Security Principles

* **Secure Password Hashing:** User passwords are secured using the **BCrypt algorithm**, providing strong, slow hashing to protect against brute-force attacks.
* **Error Management:** Extensive use of **`try-catch` / `throw exception`** throughout the application to handle and log errors gracefully, especially in data access and critical business logic.
* **Data Structures:** **C\# Collections** (e.g., `List<T>`) are used to efficiently store and manage groups of related objects, like the product catalog or items in a shopping cart.

### Data Integrity & Database Features

* **Transaction Management:** Implementation of **Database Transact / Rollback** logic ensures data integrity during multi-step operations (e.g., if inventory update fails, the sale record rolls back).
* **Performance:** Utilizes **Stored Procedure** for complex or frequently executed queries.
* **Views:** Employs **Database View** to simplify complex reporting queries and enhance data security.

### Configuration & Logging

* **Configuration File:** An external configuration file holds the **database connection string** and other application settings, allowing for easy updates without code changes.
* **Log File:** All application events, errors, and critical transaction details are saved to the file named **`Saleling.logs`**. This file can be found in the application's runtime directory: `\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows`.

## 📦 Required NuGet Packages

The following packages must be installed in your project to handle configuration, database access, and password hashing:

* **`System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager`:** Used to read the database connection string and application settings from the configuration file.
* **`System.Data.SqlClient (4.8.6)`:** The primary provider for connecting to and interacting with the Microsoft SQL Server database.
* **`BCrypt.Net-Next`:** Provides the implementation of the **BCrypt hashing algorithm** for securing user passwords.

## 🚀 Setup & Execution

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/eipna/Group08_BT3103.git](https://github.com/eipna/Group08_BT3103.git)
    ```
2.  **Database Configuration:**
    * Publish your local SQL Server database schema.
    * The application is configured to use the following **connection string** for local development:
      ```
      Data Source=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=Saleling.DB;Integrated Security=True
      ```
    * Ensure this connection string is correctly configured in your application's configuration file (e.g., `app.config`).
3.  **Run the Project:**
    * Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
    * Build the solution and run the application (F5).

### Default Login Credentials

*Note: Passwords are BCrypt-hashed in the database. These are the plaintext values for login.*

| Role | Username | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin** | `sysadmin` | `footpath1dangeravenge2` |
| **Cashier** | `johndoe` | `buggysnow1fieldapproach2` |
| **Cashier** | `janedoe` | `brown1nosemule2` |
